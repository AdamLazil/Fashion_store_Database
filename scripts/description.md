# ðŸ§  Brand & Product Matcher (Python, Fuzzy)

This script automatically **identifies the brand and type of a product** from a text string (name) in the product database. It uses **fuzzy matching** to find a match even when the name contains typos or is inaccurate.

## Problem to solve

the product in the database does not have a separately specified brand, size or type and everything is written in a text string
