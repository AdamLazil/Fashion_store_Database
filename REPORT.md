# üßæ Report Overview

This report represents a **partial demonstration** of a larger analytical project.
The complete dataset and results cannot be publicly shared due to the **sensitive nature of business data**, including sales figures and internal financial information.

The purpose of this report is therefore **to illustrate the workflow, data structure, and analytical approach** used in the project ‚Äî not to display real commercial values.
All figures and tables presented here are **for demonstration purposes only** and are intended to showcase the process of data unification, cleaning, and analysis.

# üß≠ Report Structure

The analysis is divided into four main sections, each addressing a specific part of the business process:

## üè¨ Inventory (Stock Management)

This section focuses on stock levels and product turnover.
It identifies slow-moving items, highlights overstocked categories, and evaluates opportunities to optimize inventory costs.
Visualizations include stock distribution over time and year-to-year comparisons.

## üí∞ Sales Performance

Analysis of sales trends, revenue structure, and product category performance.
It evaluates how sales evolved across different years, stores, and time periods.
The results help to identify peak sales hours, seasonal effects, and differences between stores.

## üì¶ Goods Receipts (Purchasing)

This section tracks incoming goods and supplier activity.
It compares purchase volumes with sales results to detect inefficiencies or over-purchasing.
The goal is to balance purchasing decisions with actual sales demand.

## üìä Insights & Recommendations

Based on the analysis above, this section provides data-driven recommendations for improving operational efficiency and profitability.
It focuses on inventory optimization, pricing strategy, and product mix improvements.

# üîç Key Findings

During the data analysis, several important issues were identified that affected the accuracy and reliability of the dataset, especially in earlier years:

- **Inconsistent data before 2020**:
  Records prior to 2020 were found to be unreliable because the previous management did not handle data systematically. Stock quantities often did not reflect the real inventory situation.
  The main cause was improper year-end closing ‚Äî in some years, no inventory reconciliation was performed, or it was completed months later. As a result, unsold items were not written off correctly and were carried over into the following year.

- **Lack of data entry standards**:
  Products were often entered manually without consistent naming conventions or formatting. Many records were missing purchase prices and detailed product descriptions, which complicated later analysis.

- **Inappropriate software and hardware setup**:
  The previously used POS and warehouse systems were prone to frequent outages and data loss, forcing staff to re-enter transactions manually. This led to further inconsistencies and incomplete historical records.

- **Lack of reporting and analyzing**:
  There was no systematic reporting of stock levels, and no reorder or purchase limits were defined for individual products.
  This likely led to overstocking and inefficient capital allocation, as large quantities of unsold goods tied up financial resources and reduced overall profitability.

### 1. Stock management

**Unclear and inaccurate inventory records between 2017 and 2020**:
Data related to stock management during the years 2017‚Äì2020 were found to be **highly inconsistent** and incomplete due to poor inventory tracking and missing documentation.
After applying filters and identifying certain recurring patterns ‚Äî such as **unique EAN codes combined with the date of stock entry** ‚Äî it was possible to partially reconstruct the approximate stock movements.
Based on these findings, it can be estimated that **inventory levels increased by around 10% per year**, corresponding to approximately **600 additional items annually**.

**Improved data accuracy after 2020**:
Following a complete inventory review in 2020 and the implementation of a more efficient inventory management system, the data quality has significantly improved.
However, **it was still necessary to standardize and clean the records** to ensure that the analytical results accurately reflected the real-world stock situation and provided reliable insights for further decision-making.

**Stabilization after management and system changes**:
After the change in management and the introduction of a more efficient inventory control system, the analysis shows a **significant improvement and stabilization** in stock circulation.
Year-to-year fluctuations in inventory growth have become minimal, averaging **between 1 ‚Äì 2 %**.
A slight deviation was observed in 2022, when stores were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 restrictions. During this period, stock levels increased by around **8 %**, as incoming orders had been placed several months in advance and could not be postponed.
