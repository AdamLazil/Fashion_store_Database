# üß≠ Report Structure

The analysis is divided into four main sections, each addressing a specific part of the business process:

## üè¨ Inventory (Stock Management)

This section focuses on stock levels and product turnover.
It identifies slow-moving items, highlights overstocked categories, and evaluates opportunities to optimize inventory costs.
Visualizations include stock distribution over time and year-to-year comparisons.

## üí∞ Sales Performance

Analysis of sales trends, revenue structure, and product category performance.
It evaluates how sales evolved across different years, stores, and time periods.
The results help to identify peak sales hours, seasonal effects, and differences between stores.

## üì¶ Goods Receipts (Purchasing)

This section tracks incoming goods and supplier activity.
It compares purchase volumes with sales results to detect inefficiencies or over-purchasing.
The goal is to balance purchasing decisions with actual sales demand.

## üìä Insights & Recommendations

Based on the analysis above, this section provides data-driven recommendations for improving operational efficiency and profitability.
It focuses on inventory optimization, pricing strategy, and product mix improvements.

# üîç Key Findings

During the data analysis, several important issues were identified that affected the accuracy and reliability of the dataset, especially in earlier years:

- **Inconsistent data before 2020**:
  Records prior to 2020 were found to be unreliable because the previous management did not handle data systematically. Stock quantities often did not reflect the real inventory situation.
  The main cause was improper year-end closing ‚Äî in some years, no inventory reconciliation was performed, or it was completed months later. As a result, unsold items were not written off correctly and were carried over into the following year.

- **Lack of data entry standards**:
  Products were often entered manually without consistent naming conventions or formatting. Many records were missing purchase prices and detailed product descriptions, which complicated later analysis.

- **Inappropriate software and hardware setup**:
  The previously used POS and warehouse systems were prone to frequent outages and data loss, forcing staff to re-enter transactions manually. This led to further inconsistencies and incomplete historical records.

- **Lack of reporting and analyzing**:
  There was no systematic reporting of stock levels, and no reorder or purchase limits were defined for individual products.
  This likely led to overstocking and inefficient capital allocation, as large quantities of unsold goods tied up financial resources and reduced overall profitability.

- **Inefficient capital management**:
  The former owner handled company finances irresponsibly and diverted working capital into other personal projects, many of which were **highly unprofitable.**
  This practice significantly disrupted store operations, leading to **delayed invoice payments, penalty charges**, and the **loss of early payment discounts**.
  Furthermore, no **financial reserves** were established for unforeseen circumstances, which increased the company‚Äôs financial vulnerability.

### 1. Stock management

**Unclear and inaccurate inventory records between 2017 and 2020**:
Data related to stock management during the years 2017‚Äì2020 were found to be **highly inconsistent** and incomplete due to poor inventory tracking and missing documentation.
After applying filters and identifying certain recurring patterns ‚Äî such as **unique EAN codes combined with the date of stock entry** ‚Äî it was possible to partially reconstruct the approximate stock movements.
Based on these findings, it can be estimated that **inventory levels increased by around 10% per year**, corresponding to approximately **600 additional items annually**.

**Improved data accuracy after 2020**:
Following a complete inventory review in 2020 and the implementation of a more efficient inventory management system, the data quality has significantly improved.
However, **it was still necessary to standardize and clean the records** to ensure that the analytical results accurately reflected the real-world stock situation and provided reliable insights for further decision-making.

**Stabilization after management and system changes**:
After the change in management and the introduction of a more efficient inventory control system, the analysis shows a **significant improvement and stabilization** in stock circulation.
Year-to-year fluctuations in inventory growth have become minimal, averaging **between 1 ‚Äì 2 %**.
A slight deviation was observed in 2022, when stores were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 restrictions. During this period, stock levels increased by around **8 %**, as incoming orders had been placed several months in advance and could not be postponed.

**Inventory composition and optimization**:
The inventory consists of **35 product types** of women‚Äôs clothing and accessories.
The three largest categories by volume are:

_Jeans_ ‚Äî representing **15% to 20%** of total inventory,

_T-shirts and blouses_ ‚Äî around **20% to 25%**,

_Shoes_ ‚Äî approximately **8% to 10%**.

A positive outcome of the analysis is the **gradual reduction and stabilization of inventory levels** compared to previous years.
This improvement clearly demonstrates the **effectiveness of newly introduced order limits and more efficient inventory management practices**.

_Store T1 Performance Analysis_

Store T1 was established in 2015 and demonstrated strong market acceptance by nearly doubling its turnover in the following year. Although a slight decline was recorded in 2017, this did not jeopardize the store‚Äôs operations, as the results from the previous year had already established the break-even point.

In the subsequent two years, the store achieved moderate growth, maintaining turnover levels around the break-even threshold. However, the years 2020 and 2021 brought a sharp decline due to COVID-19 restrictions, which significantly disrupted operations. The possibility of closing the store was considered, given the rising operating costs and the absence of revenue. This was ultimately avoided by financing expenses through a short-term loan.

The drastic decrease in sales in 2023 resulted from transforming the store into an outlet and relocating it to new premises. This decision aimed to reduce excess inventory and take advantage of a larger retail space. However, the move did not prove effective, as the outlet‚Äôs performance fell short of expectations, and operating costs in the new location increased.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, a decision was made to close the outlet and move the store back to its original location. The primary objective for this store is to regain the sales performance levels observed between 2017 and 2019 within the next two years.

_Store T2 Performance Analysis_

Following the successful establishment of Store T1 and the stabilization of its operational results at a relatively strong level, the decision was made to open a new store in a different location, based on a promising opportunity. The new store demonstrated immediate success, achieving a 50% increase in turnover in its first full year of operation and maintaining ‚Äî even slightly improving ‚Äî this performance in the following year.

Just like Store T1, Store T2 was affected by the COVID-19 restrictions, which forced a temporary closure and led to a sharp decline in sales, an increase in operating costs, and a buildup of inventory. However, the impact was not as severe as in the case of Store T1. Thanks to its higher sales volume and better location, the store managed to recover more quickly. In the following years, it showed a steady upward trend, gradually returning to pre-COVID levels. For the current year, a strong increase in turnover is expected, with projections indicating a full recovery to pre-pandemic figures.

The main goal for the store in the coming years is to maintain the current level of turnover while optimizing costs related to inventory management.

| T1/T2 | -52% | 15%  | 15%  | -8%  |  4%  | 12%  | 32%  | -6%  |      |

The results of the comparison between items received into stock and items sold show a generally healthy ratio over the years. In the last three years, the ratio has stabilized at approximately **1 : 1.23**, meaning that for every item received, 1.23 items are sold. This indicates that older inventory from previous years is being successfully sold off.

The extreme value observed at the beginning of the analyzed period was caused by the **opening of a new store**, where initial sales volumes were still low. However, within the following two years, the situation stabilized, and sales began to **consistently exceed stock inflows**.

Due to the **strong performance in 2023**, the product range was expanded to include several new brands, which temporarily resulted in a **negative ratio** as incoming stock volumes increased to accommodate the broader assortment.
